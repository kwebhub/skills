    details
      summary Modal verbs
      p.
        Модальные глаголы – заменяют вспомогательные глаголы. <br>
        После модальных глаголов всегда стоит инфинитив без частицы to. <br>
        Модальный глагол всегда употребляется со смысловым глаголом, который стоит в начальной форме (must do, could see). <br>
        <i>I can type very fast. — Я могу печатать очень быстро.</i> <br>
        Модальные глаголы имеют одну форму во всех лицах и числах кроме have to, который принимает форму has после местоимений he, she, it. <br>
        Модальные глаголы всегда стоят в настоящем времени (даже в контексте будущего времени), 
        однако некоторые из них могут принимать прошедшую форму:<br> can — could; may — might, must — had to. <br>
        В отрицательных и вопросительных предложениях модальные глаголы не употребляются со вспомогательными, за исключением have to. <br>
        <i>I can’t do it. — Я не могу этого сделать.</i> <br>
        <i>May I use your laptop? — Могу я воспользоваться вашим ноутбуком.</i> <br>
        <i>What do I have to sign? — Что я должен подписать?</i>
